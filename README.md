### Instructions

1. Run `npm install`

#### Notes

Things to expand on in the near future:
1. Tests for both front-end (using Jest and Enzyme) and back-end (test API routes, return data, correct data manipulation on JSON file)
2. Add a loader while waiting for JSON data to return from the API
3. Set up <NotificationBar /> to actually display error messages for better user experience
4. Better form validation in form component
5. Use database over writing directly to JSON file (also write script to do initial data import)
